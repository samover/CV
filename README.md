Samuel Overloop
===============

Driven by a passion for change I joined the [Society of Jesus](http://www.jesuit.org.uk) (aka the Jesuits), the world's oldest multinational, in order to contribute to a better world through education, community development and research. I have proven myself to be resilient, determined and pragmatic when facing problems. I left the Jesuits because I felt that I could do more in a different context. That is why I spent three intense months learning TDD and OOP in Ruby, Javascript and Swift following agile methodologies at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). Whilst already speaking English, Dutch, French, Italian, German, Spanish and a smattering of Arabic, I have now fallen in love with computer languages as well.

I am looking for a developer role where I can work with people equally passionate about coding, problem solving and making the world a better place with a focus on team work and software craftsmanship.

Coding Projects
-------------
#### [CHANGR](https://github.com/samover/changr)

Final project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we built an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had worked with before. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society receive donations on the fly with a location-aware app using **Bluetooth Beacons**.

Faithful to a TDD approach, I had to write [an ad-hoc mock](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock) for **Firebase** in Swift, which I tested using **Quick/Nimble**. Unit testing was done through **XCTest**.

A video of our presentation of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)

#### [CHITTER](https://github.com/samover/chitter)

A fully tested Twitter clone built in **Ruby on Sinatra** with a **postresql** database. This was my first project using these technologies as well as the first time I tried front-end styling in **CSS3** and **HTML5**.

The app was built in two days and can be found on [Heroku](https://badass-chitter.herokuapp.com/).

#### [INSTAGRAM](https://github.com/samover/instagram)

My first **Rails** app with **ActiveRecord**. This is an Instagram clone styled with Bootstrap. It is fully tested using **RSpec**, **Capybara** and **FactoryGirl**.

The app was built in two days and can be found on [Heroku](https://instaclone-challenge.herokuapp.com/).

#### [BOWLING SCORECARD](https://github.com/samover/bowling_scorecard)

This is my first app written in **JavaScript** using **jQuery**. It was fully test driven with **Jasmine**. The biggest challenge with this app was building the logic for the tenth frame.

#### [TO-DO LIST](https://github.com/samover/todo_list)

My first **angularJS** single page app, written over a weekend. It is a simple to-do list and tested using **Karma** and **Protractor**.

#### [TAKE AWAY BACKEND](https://github.com/samover/takeaway)

One of the first **Ruby** apps I am really proud of. This was an exercise in Objected Oriented Programming and **SOLID** design principles, and the first time I connected an app to an API. Fully tested in **RSpec**. This was also the weekend I started using **Vim** and I haven't stopped since. At a later stage, I attempted to [rebuild](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway_project) this in the **MEAN** stack (WIP).

Skills
------
#### Event Planning and Coordination

I proposed, organised and funded a successful two week summer event in Ireland called Magis for 100 participants aged 18-30 from 18 different countries. Bringing together international partners, this event is the basis and inspiration for further young adult work in Flanders and the Netherlands.

#### Team Training

I worked in the Guyanese Amazon as one of two members of the parish team in a small Amerindian village. My main responsibility consisted of training the pastoral lay administrators of the Pakaraima district. We helped them to effectively solve community conflicts; we also offered them discernment and decision making tools to engage the encroaching Western lifestyle without losing their identity.

#### Public Speaking

As a Jesuit, I gave numerous sermons and public talks. I feel comfortable before large crowds as exemplified by my experience as a secondary school teacher and main organiser of Magis.

#### Resilient Problem Solver

As part of my Jesuit training we were sent in pairs on a 40-day walking pilgrimage in Spain without any money. It was an experience that forced me to find solutions from a position of complete helplessness, facing rejections, fear, hunger and insecurity.
