****************

Formerly in education and community development all over the world, felt the need for a career change and spent three intense months learning TDD, pair programming and OOP in Ruby, Javascript and Swift at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). Whilst already speaking English, Dutch, Italian, German, Spanish and a mouthful of Arabic, I have fallen in love as well with computer languages.

Seeking a developer role where I can work with people equally passionate about coding, problem solving and making the world a better place with a focus on team work and software craftmanship.
