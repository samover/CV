Samuel Overloop
===============

I am someone passionate about bringing change who has spent four intense months learning TDD and OOP in *Ruby*, *Javascript* and *Swift* at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a coding bootcamp. I am resilient, determined and pragmatic when facing problems. I built an open-source testing framework for *Firebase* and Swift, because it did not exist yet. Whilst already speaking English, Dutch, French, Italian, German, Spanish and a smattering of Arabic, I have now fallen in love with computer languages as well.

In a previous life I was a member the [Society of Jesus](http://www.jesuit.org.uk) (aka the Jesuits), the world's oldest multinational, in order to contribute to a better world through education, community development and research. I left the Jesuits because I felt that I could have a greater social impact as a developer.

That is why I am looking for a developer role where I can work with people equally passionate about coding, problem solving and making the world a better place with a focus on team work and software craftsmanship.

Coding Projects
---------------

#### [FIREBASEMOCK](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock)

An open-source testing framework for **Swift** and **Firebase**, because it doesn't exist yet. Tested with **Quick/Nimble**. 

#### [CHANGR](https://github.com/samover/changr)

Final project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we built an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had worked with before. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society receive donations on the fly with a location-aware app using **Bluetooth Beacons**. Testing is done with **XCTest**.

A video of our presentation of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)

#### [SO SAFE](https://github.com/samover/so_safe)

Team project for Makers Academy using **angularJS** on the **Ionic** framework. We built a mobile app that allows users to let their loved ones know that they are safe in case of a disaster. We had **daily scrum** and **pair programming**. The app was developed using TDD with **Jasmine**, **Protractor** and **Karma**.

#### [TAKE AWAY BACKEND](https://github.com/samover/takeaway)

One of the first **Ruby** apps I am really proud of. This was an exercise in **Objected Oriented Programming** and **SOLID** design principles, and the first time I connected an app to an API. Fully tested in **RSpec**. This was also the weekend I started using **Vim** and I haven't stopped since. At a later stage, I attempted to [rebuild](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway_project) this in the **MEAN** stack (WIP).

Other projects I am proud of: [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/samover/bowling_scorecard) (jQuery, Jasmine), [To-do list](https://github.com/samover/todo_list) (angularJS, Karma, Protractor), [Instaclone](https://github.com/samover/instagram) (Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, RSpec, Capybara, FactoryGirl), [Chitter](https://github.com/samover/chitter) (Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, CSS3, HTML5)
