Samuel Overloop
===============

I am a resilient problem solver who has spent three months three intense months learning TDD and OOP in *Ruby*, *Javascript* and *Swift* following agile methodologies at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). I built an open-source testing framework for **Firebase** and Swift, because it did not exist yet. Whilst already speaking English, Dutch, French, Italian, German, Spanish and a smattering of Arabic, I have now fallen in love with computer languages as well.

I have proven myself to be resilient, determined and pragmatic when facing problems. Driven by a passion for change, in a previous life I was a member the [Society of Jesus](http://www.jesuit.org.uk) (aka the Jesuits), the world's oldest multinational, in order to contribute to a better world through education, community development and research. I left the Jesuits because I felt that I could do more in a different context.

That is why I am looking for a developer role where I can work with people equally passionate about coding, problem solving and making the world a better place with a focus on team work and software craftsmanship.

Coding Projects
-------------

#### [FIREBASEMOCK](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock)

An open-source testing framework for Swift and Firebase, because it doesn't exist yet. Tested with **Quick/Nimble**. 

#### [CHANGR](https://github.com/samover/changr)

Final project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we built an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had worked with before. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society receive donations on the fly with a location-aware app using **Bluetooth Beacons**. Testing is done with **XCTest**.

A video of our presentation of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)

#### [SO SAFE](https://github.com/samover/so_safe)

Makerthon project for Makers Academy using **angularJS** on the **Ionic** framework to build a mobile app that allows users to let their loved ones know that they are safe in case of a disaster. We hade **daily scrum** and programmed in pairs and developed the app using TDD with **Jasmine**, **Protractor** and **Karma**.

#### [TAKE AWAY BACKEND](https://github.com/samover/takeaway)

One of the first **Ruby** apps I am really proud of. This was an exercise in Objected Oriented Programming and **SOLID** design principles, and the first time I connected an app to an API. Fully tested in **RSpec**. This was also the weekend I started using **Vim** and I haven't stopped since. At a later stage, I attempted to [rebuild](https://github.com/Mattia46/takeaway_project) this in the **MEAN** stack (WIP).

Other projects I am proud of: [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/samover/bowling_scorecard) (jQuery, Jasmine), [To-do list](https://github.com/samover/todo_list) (angularJS, Karma, Protractor), [Instaclone](https://github.com/samover/instagram) (Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, RSpec, Capybara, FactoryGirl), [Chitter](https://github.com/samover/chitter) (Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, CSS3, HTML5)

Skills
------
#### Event Planning and Coordination

I proposed, organised and funded a successful two week summer event in Ireland called Magis for 100 participants aged 18-30 from 18 different countries. Bringing together international partners, this event is the basis and inspiration for further young adult work in Flanders and the Netherlands.

#### Team Training

I worked in the Guyanese Amazon as one of two members of the parish team in a small Amerindian village. My main responsibility consisted of training the pastoral lay administrators of the Pakaraima district. We helped them to effectively solve community conflicts; we also offered them discernment and decision making tools to engage the encroaching Western lifestyle without losing their identity.

#### Public Speaking

As a Jesuit, I gave numerous sermons and public talks. I feel comfortable before large crowds as exemplified by my experience as a secondary school teacher and main organiser of Magis.

#### Resilient Problem Solver

As part of my Jesuit training we were sent in pairs on a 40-day walking pilgrimage in Spain without any money. It was an experience that forced me to find solutions from a position of complete helplessness, facing rejections, fear, hunger and insecurity.
