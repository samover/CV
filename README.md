****************

Formerly in education and community development all over the world, felt the need for a career change and spent three intense months learning TDD, pair programming and OOP in Ruby, Javascript and Swift at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). Whilst already speaking English, Dutch, Italian, German, Spanish and a mouthful of Arabic, I have fallen in love as well with computer languages.

Seeking a developer role where I can work with people equally passionate about coding, problem solving and making the world a better place with a focus on team work and software craftmanship.

Code Examples
-------------
#### [CHANGR](https://github.com/samover/changr)

Final project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we build an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had any prior experience with. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society to receive donations on the fly using a location-aware app thanks to **Bluethooth Beacons**.

Using a TDD approach, I had to write [an ad-hoc mock](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock) for **Firebase** in Swift, which I tested using **Quick/Nimble**. Unit testing was done through **XCTest**.

The presentation video of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVZJ511cqI)

#### [CHITTER](https://github.com/samover/chitter)

A fully tested Twitter clone built in **Ruby on Sinatra** with a **postresql** databse. This is my first project using these technologies as well as the first time I tried front-end styling in **CSS3** and **HTML5**.

The app was built in two days and can be found on [Heroku](https://badass-chitter.herokuapp.com/).

#### [INSTAGRAM](https://github.com/samover/instagram)

My first rails app. This is an Instagram clone styled with Bootstrap. Of course it is fully tested using **rspec**, **capybara** and **FactoryGirl**.

The app was built in two days and can be found on [Heroku](https://instaclone-challenge.herokuapp.com/).

#### [BOWLING SCORECARD](https://github.com/samover/bowling_scorecard)

This is my first app written in **Javascript** using **jQuery**. It is fully test driven in **Jasmine**. The biggest challenge with this app was building the logic for the tenth frame.

[TODO LIST](https://github.com/samover/todo_list)

My first **angularJS** single page app written over a weekend. It is a simple Todo List and tested using **Karma** and **Protractor**.

[TAKE AWAY BACKEND](https://github.com/samover/takeaway)

One of the first **Ruby** apps I am really proud off. This was an exercise in Objected Oriented Programming and **SOLID** design principles, and the first time I connected an app to an API. Fully tested in **rspec**.
